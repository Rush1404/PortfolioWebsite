                  <p class="card-text">
                    In my sporting journey, I've immersed myself in basketball, as I spent two years in AAU basketball, playing as a shooting guard. I started taking basketball
                    seriously when I moved to Canada (from New York) in 2019, mainly because I had much easier access to a great basketball court and I hit a huge growth spurt
                    (I went from 5'4 to 6'0 that summer). After playing competitive basketball for the Silver Knights 2019-2020, I felt like I had found my true passion, since
                    I excelled at my role, but then COVID-19 hit. All my basketball camps and tournaments had been indefenitely postponed, and I was left with no access to a court
                    anymore. This went on for almost 2 years, since whenever they would attempt to start the programs again, an outbreak would occur.<br><br>

                    This series of events caused me to lose that love I once held for basketball, until this school year. I had completed all my hard courses in grade 11, so I
                    was left with nothing but easy classes and electives, one of them being Gym. Through that class, I started playing basketball again, and though I was rusty,
                    my muscle memory was preserved, and the coaches in my school could see that too (as they were gym teachers). They recommended that I tryout for the Varsity
                    Team, and after pondering on the thought of playing organized basketball again, I went for it. Little did I know, I not only made the team, but was the starting
                    SG! I loved my role on the team, as I was able to regain my passion for the game, and where I stand now, I can never see myself losing the love for this game again.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    Over the years, I have found myself hiking on local trails more and more. This all began when I moved to Canada in 2019, as living in New York and India 
                    didn't really give me opportunities to go on hikes, as they would require me to travel for hours and go to rural areas. But when I moved to Canada, I was
                    surprised when I noticed the plethora of trails that are located in close proximity to me. I started going once a month with family friends, but that soon 
                    progressed to going once a week once I got my dog, Nova in 2020.<br><br>

                    In 2021, my family and I made our first cross-country trip to Alberta & Banff National Park, and this just made my love for nature grow, seeing how happy my
                    dog was around the new scenery and smelling the new plants. During that trip, we went on several day-long hikes, resulting in us hiking over 55km in just a week.
                    This experience led us to revisit Banff once a year, during the summer, as the beauty of the area is unmatched.
